This is the github repository for the Experimental Methods course for Fall 2018. 

* I've added a Tutorials folder that will contain weekly presentation notes and any data and image source files. 
* I've now added the first week notes. 
* I've fixed some typos and graphic issues on the Introduction Notes.
* I've added the second week notes on R Markdown, along with accompanying dataset and image.
* I've added the third week notes on ggplot2 and data visualization.
* I've added the fourth week notes on dplyr and data transformation.
* I've added the fifth week notes on exploratory data analysis.
* I've added the sixth week notes on descriptive statistics and a new dataset.
